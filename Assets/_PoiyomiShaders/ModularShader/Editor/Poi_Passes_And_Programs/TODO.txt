# 9.0.47 BETA
* Adjust depth fx to function with grabpass
* Fixed a bug with the mirror section
* Changed Cubemap color adjust defaults so they function when being enabled (if your material is old just set contrast to 1)
* 


Don't know how to fix
decal depth uv0 only (uses tangents which are generated from uv0)

post 9.0
* Add udon video texture
* Use Luminance for Min Brightness when using Realistic Lighting
* use depth to move skirt out of leg geometry
* matcap spritesheet
* truchet thickness audio link
* outline grabpass with pixelation
* internal parallax no global mask
* internal parallax no way to use it as emission and it shows in the dark by default
* LTCGI
* fur
* add a no special uv toggle to decals
* scrolling emission offset by uv x or y
* UV glitching for textures
* screenspace ao in base pass
* plane uv better pano effects including fresnel effects and depth
* Paralax write to depth
